### 2. **Using Unit Tests**:

You can also use unit tests to test the functionality of your framework without needing to create a separate test app.

1. **Add a Test Target to Your Framework**:
    - Select your framework project in the Project Navigator.
    - Go to `File` > `New` > `Target`.
    - Select `iOS` > `Unit Testing Bundle` and click `Next`.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to add the test target.

2. **Write Unit Tests**:
    - Open the test target you just created.
    - Import your framework and write unit tests for its functionalities.
    - For example:
      ```swift
      import XCTest
      @testable import MyFramework

      class MyFrameworkTests: XCTestCase {
          func testExampleFunction() {
              // Your test code here

### Notes
-  To test a framework on a simulator, you can't run the framework directly since it's not an executable project (like an app). Instead, you create a test app or use unit tests. Here's how you can do both:

### 1. **Using a Test App**:

1. **Create a New App within the Same Workspace**:
    - Open your framework project in Xcode.
    - Go to `File` > `New` > `Project`.
    - Select `iOS` > `App` and click `Next`.
    - Give it a name (e.g., `FrameworkTestApp`) and save it in the same directory as your framework.

2. **Link Your Framework to the Test App**:
    - Select the `FrameworkTestApp` target in Xcode.
    - Go to the `General` tab.
    - Under `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content`, click `+`.
    - Add your framework.

* About Hearing Test Results:

Hearing test results (audiograms) display the result of a pure-tone audiometry test. It shows how loud sounds need to be in order for you to hear them. The result is an average for each ear based on four frequencies (500Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz).
```

- There are four frequencies important for understanding speech. Hearing loss is classified based on the average loss across those frequencies. The World Health Organization classifies loss into five levels.

```
Little to No Loss

At less than 25 dB of loss, you should have almost no problem hearing. You can hear a whisper.

You can also add custom slash commands pretty easily. To add commands, just create a `.claude/commands` folder, add the command name as a file with a `.md` extension. You just write these in natural language and you can use the `$ARGUMENTS` string to place arguments into the prompt.

For example, if I want to output a test, I can create `.claude/commands/test.md`:

```
# .claude/hooks/test.md
Please create comprehensive tests for: $ARGUMENTS

Test requirements:
- Use Jest and React Testing Library
- Place tests in __tests__ directory
- Mock Firebase/Firestore dependencies
- Test all major functionality
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Test MobX observable state changes
- Verify computed values update correctly
- Test user interactions
- Ensure proper cleanup in afterEach
- Aim for high code coverage

- It is possible to acquire crucial information from user testing of lo-fi prototypes early in the design process (layout and navigation flow).

- According to the level of fidelity of the prototype, we can gain different types of information (cognitive or visual) from user testing.

- It is fundamental to gather cognitive design information before other issues, such as attractive visual assets.

At different stages of the development process, there are various tools that user experience designers can use to validate their concepts or designs. But, whatever prototype we may use, testing it is the only way that will help us learn about user interactions to enhance the user experience.

## Hypothesis Testing

### Scientific Method in Action

Sequential Thinking enables **explicit hypothesis testing**:

```
1. Observe symptoms
2. Generate hypothesis
3. Test hypothesis
4. If failed → Generate new hypothesis (go to step 2)
5. If succeeded → Verify thoroughly
6. Provide answer with confidence
```

With cloze deletion, a salient keyword is hidden from the passage, giving you an opportunity to pause and actively recall the missing information. This might sound trivial, but the simple act forces you to focus on the surrounding context and search your mind. This effort, in turn, is scientifically proven to form stronger memories enabling you to retain profoundly more of what you've read.

Readwise helps you remember more of what you read using two principles borrowed from cognitive science: [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall). Active recall (also known as quizzing, testing, or retrieval) is the process by which we challenge our minds to retrieve a piece of information. Simply rereading a passage from time to time, on the other hand, is passive. Rereading is no doubt better than never revisiting the passage, but research has repeatedly shown that active recall is significantly more effective. So how can you take advantage of active recall in Readwise? For any highlight that you wish to deliberately commit to memory, hit the Master icon in the web app (keyboard shortcut m)

## When the Magic Happens

Sequential Thinking truly shines when:

1. **The path isn't clear** - You need to explore to find the solution
2. **Assumptions might be wrong** - You need flexibility to revise
3. **Multiple approaches exist** - You need to compare alternatives
4. **The problem is complex** - Simple answers won't cut it

Conclusion

It is evident that low-fi is used to test cognitive aspects of the design, such as the layout of controls and the navigation flow, but not physical aspects such as tactile, auditory, and visual feedback that requires a higher level of fidelity.

The three main points that we can extract from this article are:

- It is possible to acquire crucial information from user testing of lo-fi prototypes early in the design process (layout and navigation flow).

		•	Keeps the main session’s memory clear
		•	Isolates context for specialized tasks
		•	Lets agents “swap in” focused memory on demand
5. (Optional) Integrate a Memory MCP Server
	For truly persistent, cross-session memory:
		•	Connect Claude Code with a compatible Model Context Protocol [[MCP memory server]]
		•	Use the server’s API or built-in integrations for semantic search and automatic context retention
		•	Enables seamless recall of information from prior sessions, even across projects
These structured steps enable persistent, self-refreshing context in Claude Code, dramatically improving project continuity and developer productivity.

2. Sequential Thinking → Reason about the data systematically
3. REPL → Test hypotheses with code
4. Regular Conversation → Communicate results clearly
```

## 📐 Best Practices

### Starting
- Estimate conservatively (5-7 thoughts)
- State all constraints upfront
- Plan your approach

### During
- Adjust `total_thoughts` dynamically
- Revise when assumptions prove wrong
- Branch for alternatives
- Add checkpoints every 5 thoughts (if long)

### Finishing
- Verify solution against requirements
- Check edge cases
- Only finish when truly satisfied

# Highlights

The recession of 2007 to 2009 was still the most painful since the Depression. At its depths, $15 trillion in household wealth had disappeared, ravaging the pensions and college funds of Americans who had thought their money was in good hands. Nearly 9 million workers lost jobs; 9 million people slipped below the poverty line; 5 million homeowners lost homes.

## Troubleshooting Code Block Issues in Obsidian

Here are a few solutions to common problems, as I see it:

-   **The code block isn't appearing**. This might occur if the formatting is off. Double check that the code block is surrounded by backticks (\`\`\`).
-   **The formatting is off**. This could happen if the code block isn't indented properly. Ensure the code block is indented four spaces.
-   **The code block isn't functioning**. This could occur if the code block isn't run correctly. Ensure that it's run with the appropriate language.

### Tips for testing and validating code blocks in different contexts

I personally find these few tips helpful for validating my code blocks:

-   For me, the "Preview" button is a lifesaver. I always preview my code blocks before executing them to ensure that the formatting is correct and it works as intended.
-   Executing the code block through the "Run" button is a crucial step in the process

Readwise offers increasing degrees of active recall intensity (Mastery). The least demanding is a deceptively simple technique called [cloze deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test), more commonly known as "fill in the blank". With cloze deletion, a salient keyword is hidden from the passage, giving you an opportunity to pause and actively recall the missing information

- **Verify reasoning**: See if Claude's logic matches your understanding
- **Catch errors early**: Spot wrong assumptions before final answer
- **Learn the process**: Understand how to approach similar problems
- **Trust the answer**: See the evidence trail
- **Collaborate**: Interject if reasoning goes off track

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Name Your Branches Clearly

```
Good: branch_id = "async_with_queue"
Bad: branch_id = "option2"
```

---

### Tip 2: Use Checkpoints in Long Sequences

Every 5 thoughts in sequences > 10 thoughts total.

---

### Tip 3: Explicitly State What You're Skipping

```
"Skipping analysis of edge case X as it only affects 0.1% of users..."
```

---

### Tip 4: Front-Load Verification Criteria

```
T1: "Solution must satisfy: < 100ms latency, < $500/month cost, handles 10K req/s"
```

---

### Tip 5: Use Revision Purposefully

Not every wrong turn needs explicit revision - only significant redirections.

### When Each Is Better

**Use Regular Conversation when**:
- Problem is straightforward
- You trust Claude's expertise
- Speed matters more than transparency
- You don't need to see the work

**Use Sequential Thinking when**:
- Problem is complex or ambiguous
- You want to verify the reasoning
- Multiple approaches need evaluation
- Learning the process matters
- Stakes are high and errors costly

---

## The Meta-Cognitive Advantage

### Thinking About Thinking

Sequential Thinking enables **meta-cognition** - thinking about your thinking:

```
Thought 5: "I'm spending too much time on this detail"
          "Let me step back and reconsider the big picture"
          
Thought 6: "Actually, this detail doesn't matter for the solution"
          "Ignoring it and moving forward"
```

### Self-Awareness in Action
- Recognize when stuck in wrong direction
- Identify when making unwarranted assumptions
- Notice when missing key information
- Realize when overthinking

(thoroughness > speed)

**When problematic**:
- Quick questions
- Casual conversation
- Time-sensitive queries

---

### ⚠️ Context Window

**Issue**: Very long thought sequences can consume context.

**Impact**:
- After 15-20 thoughts, context pressure increases
- May need to summarize earlier thoughts
- Risk of losing important details

**Mitigation**:
- Keep thoughts focused and concise
- Aim for 5-10 thoughts for most problems
- Reserve 15+ thought sequences for truly complex issues

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Premature Conclusion

**Symptom**: Finishing before thorough verification.

**Example**:
```
T5: Found solution! (next_thought_needed = false)
[But didn't verify against constraints]
```

**Solution**: Always add verification step:
```
T5: Proposed solution
T6: Verify against all constraints
T7: Confirmed complete (next_thought_needed = false)
```

---

### Issue 2: Analysis Paralysis

**Symptom**: Too many thoughts without progress.

  "total_thoughts": 8,
  "next_thought_needed": false,
  "thought": "Solution verified against all constraints. Final answer: ..."
}
```

---

## Optional Parameters

These parameters enable advanced reasoning patterns:

### `is_revision` (boolean)

**Purpose**: Signals that this thought revises or reconsiders previous thinking.

**When to Use**:
- Discovered error in earlier reasoning
- Initial assumption was wrong
- New information contradicts earlier thoughts
- Need to correct the reasoning path

**Example**:
```json
{
  "thought_number": 5,
  "is_revision": true,
  "revises_thought": 3,
  "thought": "Actually, my assumption in thought 3 was wrong. 
             The bottleneck isn't the database but the cache layer."
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Makes corrections explicit
- Shows self-awareness
- Improves final answer quality
- Demonstrates critical thinking

## Revision Strategies

### Early Revision

Catch errors early:

```
T1: Initial understanding
T2: First approach
T3: Actually, T1 was wrong (REVISE)
T4: Corrected approach
```

**Benefit:** Prevents building on false premises.

---

### Late Revision

Discover issues near completion:

```
T1-T5: Build solution
T6: Verify... wait, doesn't handle edge case X
T7 [REVISE T5]: Adjusted solution for edge case
T8: Re-verify - now complete
```

**Benefit:** Ensures thorough validation.

---

### Multiple Revisions

Don't hesitate to revise repeatedly:

```
T1: Understanding
T2: Approach A
T3 [REVISE T2]: Actually, approach B
T4: Details of B
T5 [REVISE T3]: Wait, hybrid A+B is better
T6: Final hybrid approach
```

**Benefit:** Shows genuine problem-solving process.

The magnitude of the self-preservation instinct corresponds to the two most powerful motivations in life: hunger and love. While the [fulfillment] satisfaction of the eternal hunger guarantees self-preservation, the gratification of love secures its furtherance. In truth, these two impulses are the rulers of life.

how we think into two modes of thought, dubbed System 1 and System 2. — location: [4838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014EOUMZA&location=4838) ^ref-29604

---
System 1 includes all the various modules churning away below the surface of our conscious awareness. It is automatic, “fast,” intuitive thinking, driven by unconscious reactions and heuristics—rough-and-ready strategies shaped by prior experience. When you manage to make your coffee in the morning or drive from home to work without really paying attention to what you are doing, it’s System 1 that is in charge. System 2 is our conscious, “slow,” rational mode of thinking. It demands attention; when you’re concentrating on a hard math problem, that’s System 2’s job. — location: [4839](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014EOUMZA&location=4839) ^ref-58536

## Common Parameter Patterns

### Linear Progression
```json
T1: {thought_number: 1, total_thoughts: 5, next_thought_needed: true}
T2: {thought_number: 2, total_thoughts: 5, next_thought_needed: true}
T3: {thought_number: 3, total_thoughts: 5, next_thought_needed: true}
T4: {thought_number: 4, total_thoughts: 5, next_thought_needed: true}
T5: {thought_number: 5, total_thoughts: 5, next_thought_needed: false}
```

### With Revision
```json
T1: {thought_number: 1, total_thoughts: 5}
T2: {thought_number: 2, total_thoughts: 5}
T3: {thought_number: 3, total_thoughts: 6, is_revision: true, revises_thought: 2}
T4: {thought_number: 4, total_thoughts: 6}
```

se but the cache layer."
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Makes corrections explicit
- Shows self-awareness
- Improves final answer quality
- Demonstrates critical thinking

---

### `revises_thought` (integer)

**Purpose**: Specifies which thought number is being reconsidered.

**Requirements**:
- Only used when `is_revision = true`
- Must reference a previous thought number
- Must be less than current `thought_number`

**Example Revision Flow**:
```json
// Thought 3: Original
{
  "thought_number": 3,
  "thought": "The issue is caused by database queries"
}

// Thought 6: Revision
{
  "thought_number": 6,
  "is_revision": true,
  "revises_thought": 3,
  "thought": "After checking metrics, thought 3 was incorrect. 
             The issue is actually the cache layer, not database."
}
```

**Multiple Revisions**:
You can revise the same thought multiple times:
```json
// First revision
{"thought_number": 5, "is_revision": true, "revises_thought": 2}

Thought 6: Verify hypothesis against constraints
Thought 7: Confirmed - provide final answer
```

### Dynamic Planning

Unlike a rigid plan, Sequential Thinking is **adaptive**:

- **Start**: Estimate 5 thoughts needed
- **Midway**: Realize it's more complex, adjust to 8 thoughts
- **Later**: Find a simpler path, reduce to 6 thoughts
- **End**: Realize more validation needed, extend to 9 thoughts

## The Core Philosophy

### Embrace Uncertainty
- Start without knowing the full path
- Question your own assumptions
- Revise when you learn something new
- Extend when complexity emerges

### Make Thinking Visible
- Every step has a reason
- Every revision has a cause
- Every branch has a purpose
- Every conclusion has evidence

### Value Process Over Speed
- Better to think carefully than quickly
- Better to revise than persist with errors
- Better to explore than commit too early
- Better to verify than assume

### Ask Follow-up Questions After

Once Claude finishes, you can:

```
"Can you elaborate on Thought 5 about the caching strategy?"

"What would change if we had budget constraints?"

"Can you explore the alternative you mentioned in Thought 3?"
```

---

## When NOT to Request It

### Simple Questions

```
❌ "Use sequential thinking to tell me what 2+2 is"
✅ "What's 2+2?"
```

---

### Quick Lookups

```
❌ "Use sequential thinking to find the capital of France"
✅ "What's the capital of France?"
```

---

### Casual Chat

```
❌ "Use sequential thinking to chat about the weather"
✅ "How's the weather been?"
```

---

### When Time is Critical

```
❌ "Production is down! Use sequential thinking..."
✅ "Production is down! Quick diagnosis needed!" 
    [Then maybe detailed analysis later]
```

---

## Combining with Other Requests
